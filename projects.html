            The rules are in principle analogous to

            but in three dimensions. Right now, multiple geometries are supported
            (cubical tilings, permutahedra tilings, and even a 120-cell), generated 
            9using a very crude convex hull algorithm.
            Topological features such as holes can be detected, but they do not
            have impact on the game play yet.

            A level editor for Super Mario World, which is currently abandoned.
            It features a working emulator for (a part of) the SNES (adapted 
            from <a href="https://bsnes.dev/">bsnes</a>), 
            which it uses to display game specific objects without reverse
            engineering how they are supposed to interact. To make the editing
            part possible, it also features an assembler for the wdc65816 (the chip
            of the SNES), which is fast enough to reassemble the whole ROM in under 16ms 
            to ensure rendering at 60fps.

            It creates a small solar system using a method similar to the one
            outlined in the blog post but adapted to a sphere (in 3d space).
            Thus, the path tracing is done on the sphere instead of the circle and is then mapped onto
            a texture without introducing discontinuities when projecting back.

            A classical game for two on a chess board, see 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_games">wikipedia</a>, 
            but with the twist that there are more wolves and more sheeps. This
            program solves these types of games. Two wolves and six sheep is a win
            for the wolves with perfect play, while seven sheep can contain the
            two wolves. To make the search quicker, the boards are represented 
            using two 32-bit integers and moves are generated using bithacks.

            (the "theory" being the connectedness of atoms) and then solved with

        A  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slitherlink">slitherlink</a>
        program. It takes the riddles from
        <a href="https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Slitherlink/index.htm">janko.at</a>
        as input. It has two advantages over the puzzle applet provided there.
        First, it also/only works offline. Second, the input handling is a bit more convenient.
        The left mouse button toggles between filled and unknown, while the right mouse 
        button toggles between empty and unknown, which is in the authors opinion easier
        than the stateful approach at janko.at. Moreover, it automatically fills
        whole regions when this is implied by the edges, which is a real time saver.
